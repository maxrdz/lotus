Code of Conduct
===============

The Lotus Shell project Code of Conduct is based on
`The Ruby Community Conduct Guideline`_.

.. _The Ruby Community Conduct Guideline: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/conduct/

This document provides community guidelines for a safe, respectful,
productive, and collaborative place for any person who is willing to
contribute to the Lotus project. It applies to all “collaborative
space”, which is defined as community communications channels (such
as instant message channels (e.g. Matrix), mailing lists, submitted
patches, commit comments, etc.).

    * Participants will be tolerant of opposing views.
    * Participants must ensure that their language and actions are
      free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
    * When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants
      should always assume good intentions.
    * Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will
      not be tolerated.

If you believe that someone is violating the Code of Conduct, or
have any other concerns, please contact a project maintainer.
